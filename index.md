# 👋
_Computer science graduate based in Sydney. Australian and Italian dual citizen 🇦🇺🇮🇹_ <br>

I am seeking work within the field of computer science and am focused on maximizing the amount I can learn and
develop technically and professionally. Systems programming, graphics, ML systems, and embedded systems
interest me greatly.
I have completed a 3 years Bachelor's and aim to undertake a master's degree sometime in the future.

Skills:
- Python3, C, Java, Scala
- Linux/Debian, bash, Jenkins CI, git
- Web protocols, REST API's, networking
- PostgreSQL, sqLite, database programming 
- Agile development methodologies and project development tools (scrum,
agile, XP, Jira)
- OO, functional and imperative programming paradigms.
- Tensorflow, openCV, numpy, flask
- CUDA , openMP, pthread, Cache hierarchy, coding for multiple cores.

# 👨‍💻 University Projects

**Undergraduate Capstone Project** <br>
implementation and training of a DRAN CNN (UNET style architecture) and gigapixel image pipeline  for the bitmasking of glioblastoma cancer cells from TCGA-GBM and TCGA-LG '.svs' datasets.  
  - Implemented CNN in python (tensorflow) based on research paper specifications
  - Wrote code for training, tuning and analysing the performance of the CNN
  - designed and coded gigapixel image pipeline for computing bitmasks for the large dataset of whole slide images
  - Wrote unit tests
  - deployed system on university GPU-server
  - **_Technologies used:_** python3, openCV, numpy, keras, tensorflow, linux, bash, celery[redis], flask
<br><br>

**JOS kernel and userspace file system** <br>
Implemented the JOS kernel (created by MIT) @ EPFL in CS-323. Code covers:
- Booting (32 bit x86 boot process)
- Memory management
- User environments
- Premptive multitasking
- File system, spawn and shell
- **_Skills and Technologies_**: C, assembly, kernel programming, navigating a medium-size C and assembly code base, C, UNIX
<br><br>

**txt4libnds (personal project)** <br>
Simple text engine library for libNDS development. 
- coded a simple system to create and manage 'text objects' for your nintendo ds projects.
- see github 
<br><br>

**Firmware/ Embedded Software Development: Multiplayer Battleships Clone for the Nintendo DS** <br>
Designed and Implemented a game on the Nintendo DS entirely in c.
- Coded using WIFI, graphics, and button hardware interfaces (required complete knowledge of NDS hardware design)
- interrupts 
<br><br>

**Multiprocessor (NUMA) and CUDA experiments in c**<br>
Various experiments to develop a thorough understanding of the specific coding challenges associated with maximising performance on multiprocessor CPU and GPU systems.
- ***Experiments:***
  1. heat transfer simulation with openMP
  2. Monte-Carlo-Intergration with openMP and pthreads
  3. NUMA memory reordering detection
  4. CUDA heat transfer simulation
<br><br>

**Motion block visulisation**<br>
Motion estimation and visuliation algorithm in python3 with cv2 using sqrt(SSD) macro block matching 
- see github page
<br><br>

**16-bit CPU design in Verilog**<br>
Designed and implemented a 16-bit CPU and python assembler with the following operations :
- LD, MOV, ADD, SUB, XOR, LDPC, BRCH, MUL, PUSH, POP, CALL, RET, CP, BREQ, BRLO, BRHI, MUL_MS, BFLY 
- see github page

**Other**<br>
- **Orderksies Scala functional labs**
- **B-Tree datastructure in c (thread safe)**
