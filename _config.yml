description:  Computer science Bachelor @ USYD and EPFL (Switzerland) My passion for computer science took root at the age of 13 when I started building computers, setting up servers, scripting terminal programs in C#, and designing video games within the Unity engine. Soon after, I delved into the world of electronics, experimenting with both analog and digital circuits through general electronics and Arduino microcontrollers. I continually strive to nurture and sustain the same passion and creativity that first sparked my joy for computing. In addition to my technical inclinations, I've cultivated skills in graphic design and digital illustration, reflecting my artistic side. A deep appreciation for music has led me to master piano and guitar, delve into music theory, and explore music production and sound engineering. These varied interests and skills not only enrich my perspective but also inform my approach to problem-solving in computer science.
